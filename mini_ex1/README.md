My first independent experience with  the coding language p5js was quite exploratory. I tried to use different resources from the  p5.js reference page, to discover and understand the possibilities that the language offers. I attempted to create a mini-game, and failed. I tried to create a 'loading page', and failed. Finally I tried to incorporate the acceleration of the movements of the mouse, to create some kind of program that would dissolve the dynamic and physical barrier that exist when a person uses a computer, and succeeded (more or less). The method of trial and error has given me a lot of knowledge about syntax in p5js.

In my opinion the interpretation of the natural language seems to be more forgiving, compared to a coding language where a missing semicolon can prevent the program from running. So when writing code you simple have to be more careful and precise - though this doesn't mean that there's only one way to write the codes! There seems to be endless possibilities when it comes to combining operaters, functions and variables, and that's why the process of coding is very creative one. One of the perks of this precision in coding languages is the lack of misunderstandings. In our natural spoken and written languages the frames for interpretation are so undefined that we often end up misinterpretating the messages, because we have assigned different values and connotations to words and scenarios. This is phenomenon is completely absent in coding language and this makes way for a very direct and productive form of communication between computer and man.
