<h3>Objects</h3>
At first I tried to create a game with a bicycle object (which can be seen if the source for 'sketch2.js' is changed to 'sketch.js'. By creating the visual element before assigning it to a class function proved to be a mistake, since I lost track of the procedure and syntax for creating classes. Therefore I chose to create a program in which I would focus on the use of a class. The smiley-generator is the result, which varies in color/mood and size/weight!

Getting into object-orientated programming has been an eye-opener. Coming from the kind of command-based javascript we have been used to, it is fun to feel how my mental handling of the code is changing. From something very diffuse to something more concrete. One of the more fascinating things is how you have to watch and analyze the world around you to assign characteristics and abilities to an object. How your way of interpreting the world around you can affect your program and visa versa. This comes to show in my code with the use of colors matched with the mood of the smileys. The use of these colors are clearly based on other smileys I have encountered and characters in comic books or cartoon movies.

If I should have explored or went even further in my first experience with classes I might have given my object some more methods. This could be rolling, change of mood if touched or and ability to jump.
