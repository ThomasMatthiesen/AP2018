<h3>Entertainment</h3>
My program is based on easy and free entertainment which seems to flourish on the internet. People tend to like this kind of "flowing" and meaningless entertainment and seldomly ask no questions to the source of this. Therefore people tend to be willing to give up personal information, because the entertainment seems harmless.
My original goal was to incorporate more 'input'-fields - one for each piece of information, such as name, address, date of birth and so on. This was supposed to look like a standard form that we have filled in multiple times during our life, which again strengthens its image as being harmless. This coding was too hard for me, so I just ended up including one 'input'-field.

"The computer interface does away with the analog mechanical functionality, but the function of buttons here is to signify the same stable denotation, even though its material basis is gone" (SÃ¸ren Pold, Software Studies - a Lexicon, 2008). Pold is addressing some of the same conflicts occuring in the use of buttons as I mentioned above. Eventhough the digital button isn't really very close to an analog button, when it comes to material and mechanics, the action taking place is very much alike. This makes us trust the digital button just as much as an analog one and lures us press it.
