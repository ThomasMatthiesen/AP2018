I have made a quiet simple flowchart showing the main function of my mini_ex2. The difficulty in drawing a flow chart is to choose how detailed it should be and which information it should contain. I think the most important thing here is to consider the audience for the flowchart - or how you want to use the flowchart. To much technical detail might obscure the program for people that are not interested in this information, and a to shallow flowchart might not define the functions of the program well-enough to people working with technicalities.
So it's a balance-issue, which can only be solved by reflecting over the audience, the use of and the need for technical information in the flowchart.

<h3>Idea: Neutralizer of web content</h3>

We mainly want to focus on the topic of code and language in the digital culture. We want to create a program that can manipulate what is visually accessible to you, and often forced upon you while you are engaged in the digital world. We want to challenge the lacking of control of the contemporary constant feeds and data streams that we experience on the web. This by creating something that affords the individual to choose and take control of what is shown to them and therefore make web content from external sources less powerful (ex. the browser extension AdBlock).
Our ideas strives from a program that removes adjectives, to one that neutralizes genders or even one that can change negative words into positive ones. To make a program with functions like these, we will have to make a web extension that is able to examine the content of the current webpage and be able replace or manipulate it.
The flowchart we have made for this idea is based on an algorithm that is supposed to get the news articles from a website, analyse the text for adjectives and then remove them. When the program as gone through the whole text it shall print the new and changed article.

<h3>The second idea, flowchart and algorithms</h3>

Our idea for the second flowchart is in the same category as our first idea. Instead of a program that removes adjectives, we want this program to have an input field where you can write different words you don’t want to read articles about. So like our first idea the program will get an article or some other content from a website, and then analyse the content for the keywords that you didn’t want to see. This program gives the users some control of what they are going to look at online by choosing what not to see. 


A difference between my own personal flowchart and a group flowchart is that the latter was made as a kind of sketch for future work. A way of communication between five members in a group, and therefore as a tool to align our aims and prospects for our project. My own personal flowchart on the other hand has been made on a finished program, giving more in-depth and clear information on its functionality, and as a tool to show these functionalities to an outside audience in a understandable manner.
As I mentioned earlier; there are many ways to create and shape a flowchart based on your final use of it. This links up nicely with the way algorithms can be understood. Basically there are many ways of solving the same problem and this is the situation with algorithms too. This leads to complexity and a certain problem setting in our modern world, as Finn puts it:
"We live, for the most part, in a world built by algorithmic pragmatists. Indeed, the ambition and scale of corporate operations like Google means that their definitions of algorithms - what the problems are, and how to solve them - can profoundly change the world" (Ed Finn, 2007). What Finn expresses here is that the way we interpret and solve the problems given to us will in the end define us and our surroundings. That is why a big company like Google has a big responsibility when taking decisions about algorithms and how they solve there problems. When making a flowchart in a group we are not having such a tremendous responsibility - but we do have some. The way we present a program through a flowchart will definitely affect the program's functionality in the end. This must be taken into considerations when using a flowchart and defining a program through this organisation and visualisation tool.
