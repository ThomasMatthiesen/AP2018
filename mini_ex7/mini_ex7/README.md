## The program

In this mini_ex I worked together with Jesper Vendelbo and Jakob Duus and adapted the old childrens song "This Old Man" to javascript! At first we tried to create a functional program with a storyline in the code itself, but due to a peculiar fact this did not succeed. It was really hard to keep track of the functions and variables when their names were non-logical, and this led to complications when writing a functional code.

This is a major distinction between code and natural language. The computer can't make 'auto-corrections' when it encounters a mistake in a "sentence" - like humans do when sentences they hear/read contains grammatical mistakes. The computer language does not contain intern humor, sarcasm, proverbs and linguistic whimsiness.

My experience with adapting and fitting the natural language into the computation language javascript has shown me nothing but the fact that this only will lead to comprises in both languages.
