<h3>My code</h3>
In this weeks mini exercise I have tried to challenge my coding skills while incorporating Goriunova's (2014) notion of fun and her description of its relation to computing. I've coded a interactive screen that lets you control a foot and choose which item it gets to step on. Because of the amount of images and sound in the preload() function, I decided to create a loading page, which let me to explore CSS styling.

<h3>FUN!</h3>
Goriunova (2014) says: "Humour here is indicative of the pleasure of breakthrough, of thought experimentation, of unconstrained and purposeless but intense and curious and materially specific enquiry." (p. 2). And I must say that this exercise let to many breakthroughs, experiments and challenges, which felt without any bigger meaning, but still let me explore without borders. Therefore this experience has been fun from my point of view. If my program is fun to the individual person is hard to say, but I have tried to keep it in a simple design, with very basic structures, actions, sounds and shapes (though I provide imagery and icons), to keep it relatable for a lot of people. I have done this because humour is very related to bias, setting and culture.
