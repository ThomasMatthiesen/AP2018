Here is the program: (if you hold down a key it will exclude the letter)

<h3>Random Words</h3>

In my generative art program I have tried to incorporate the use of language in its much unframed and unlimited manner. My intention was to randomize the appearance of the letters, so that the canvas would letters that the viewer would have to interpret and analyze to find words and meanings - making it a very personal piece of art. Whether I have succeeded in this or not is up to the perceiver.

One point where my program differs from other generative art programs is the fact that all vowels are marked with colors and the fact that when a letter-key is pressed, the letter is removed from the array and the screen too. The idea of generative art is to setup the starting point for the program to run and then let the computer(randomizer) create the artwork itself (if the finished canvas on the screen is seen as the artwork, instead of the code behind it). In my program it is possible for my audience to affect the outcome, which might be that generative in the end.

Another point of my program is that it is possible to run it forever, which leads to a final picture that is never final, but it turns kind of "solid" because of the huge amount of letters, only varying in the layers of colors.
