<h3>Inefficient code</h3>
I will grade my attempt to create throbber as being both succesful and a bit of a failure. A created my own unique throbber, but due to my lack of understanding about functions and efficient use of conditional statements my code is very long, messy and <strong>inefficient</strong>!
I used the same four blocks of code to create the lines that are moving around in a square-like formation, and for each block I used several blocks of 'if-statements' to move the lines around. I'm sure this could be done more neatly and efficiently - but after a long time of experimenting, I simply gave up my attempt to create an overall function for this program.

<h3>Time</h3>
Funny enough this inefficiency that occurs in my code fits the theme of this weeks mini exercise; time/temporality. My program is based on four lines doing cycles of movements in different velocities, which leads to an impression of the lines running syncopated and then in a more unison way - creating different shapes as they make their way through the overall cycle. This is my attempt to create a throbber that isn't so predictable and therefore boring. It creates a sense of tension and release when the lines are out of order and returns back into a more structured picture. I really tried to frame an idea that revolves around the fact that you don't need to be bored or frustrated when waiting for something - rather you could actually be entertained. This entertainment though comes mostly from within the person waiting. I think a kind of reflective and meditative moment can occur when waiting, especially when simple yet diffuse structures, like my throbber are infront of the  person waiting for progress. I think a throbber can be relaxing and comforting, instead of frustrating and boring.
